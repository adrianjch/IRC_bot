# IRC_bot
My first IRC bot.
Current bot interactions:
- "o/" returns a "\o"


- "ringringringringringringring" returns a "BANANAPHONE!"


- When someone joins to the channel it says a random welcome message.
{user} has arrived. The party is over.


- When someone leaves the channel it says a random goodbye message.
Have a nice day!


- ".rr" plays a Russian Roulette. 1/6 chances to die.
[rr] {user} slowly pulls the trigger...
[rr] *click* - nothing happens. {user} will live another day. Who's next? Misses since last death: X.


- ".rrstats" shows some stats of the command .rr        
The trigger was pulled XX times, XX shots were fired. That's XX.XX%. Highest streak: XX, broken by XXXXXXXX.


- ".suicide" returns a random suicide message.
{bot} was so swag that {user} died due to it. #Swag


- ".pun" returns a random pun message.
I'm practicing for a bug-eating contest and I've got butterflies in my stomach.
